## Did you know that paper money 纸币 was first used in ancient China around the 11th century 宋朝?  
Paper money was used broadly during those days due to shortage of copper and the convenience of paper money.   However, the convenience combined with the unlimited power of the government to print money lead to inflation, subsequently the loss of credibility of the government, and its evenual downfall. So, even though the Northern Song dynasty had an advance monetary system, its credit failed due to long and costly wars.
